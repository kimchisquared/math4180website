## Assessment
It is our intent to design assessments that are a source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress. Assessments serve the purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved of the course goals). The time zones indicated for all assessments are in Central Standard Time.

|You will complete a project with a group of 3-4 students. The project will focus on creating a model to classify patient health data and requires a submission to the associated Kaggle competition. You will apply the methods learned in this course to answer whether patients in Intensive Care Units have been diagnosed with a certain type of diabetes which could inform treatment and ultimately lead to better outcomes. The sections of this project will be communicated to you in advance and with more detail |

## Communication Etiquette 
### Slack communications
Most of our online comminication will take place on Slack. While communicating online, please note the following:

- Before posting a question, please make sure that the same question has not been posted before.
- Slack channels are:
  - *in-class*: chat during Zoom lectures
  - *resources*: reading responses
  - *wids-datathon*: project discussion
  - *people*: bios of everyone in the course 
- If you choose to post memes or any jokes, be mindful. Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics jokes are always welcome.
- Respect opinions of others.
- There are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask.
- If somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, show them in which lecture we have covered the topic.
- Be generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other.
- Answer each other's questions. 

### Email communications
Please only email about course content if it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on Slack so that we can all learn together. This way the instructors will only have to answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact one of your peers may even answer it before one of us do. 

While communicating over email, please make sure the email
- has an informative subject line including the course code.
- articulates your question or problem well.
- has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards etc.
- has your name at the end.
