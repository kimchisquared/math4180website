## Course Objectives
At the end of this semester you will be able to:
- perform data visualization, data cleaning, data augmentation and data organization|
- apply ethical uses of data in using results of data analytic
- discern appropriate statistical, computational, and modeling approaches to data problems
- write technical and nontechnical reports of data analytic insights 
- write professional level correspondence to ask questions/gather information
- give professional level presentations to technical and nontechnical audiences whether in academic or industrial settings

## Assessment
It is our intent to design assessments that are a source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress. Assessments serve the purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved of the course goals). The time zones indicated for all assessments are in Central Standard Time.

|-----|
|**Participation** |
| Attendance and participation during class Zoom lectures is essential and expected. Project team meetings outside of class will be required. |
|**Evaluations**|
| Starting week 4, project groups will get together to delegate the group roles for project related assignments. You are required to contribute equally to any group task(s) assigned to you. As this is the first hands-on experience for many of the students in the course, there may come a time where a single task turns out to be more time-consuming than originally planned. This is the only time re-delegating tasks is acceptable. As such, you will be required to submit evaluations on your yourself, documenting the tasks you have completed along with your group. The goal of the evaluations is to prepare you and your group members to write and finalize your technical report of the project in a timely manner.|
|**Reading Responses and Assignments**|
|You are required to complete weekly reading and/or coding tasks as outlined on the course website. The schedule is fluid and may be adjusted to ensure the timeliness of tasks and data project are appropriate for the course |
| **Project** |
|**Overview**: You will complete a project with a group of 3-4 students. The project will focus on creating a model to classify patient health data and requires a submission to the associated competition. You will apply the methods learned in this course to answer whether patients diagnoses could inform treatment and ultimately lead to better outcomes. The sections of this project will be communicated to you in advance and with more detail. |
|**Presentation**: Your group will give a final 30-minute group presentation that may be recorded.  This presentation will be held during the last week of class for this course. The specific date each group presents will be announced later on in the semester. |
|**Technical Paper**: Your group will write a technical paper summarizing the work of the semester. The breadth, depth and scope of the content will determine the length (minimum 3-pages written in the style of a LaTex journal article). Resources for technical writing and LaTex will be shared under the Materials section as the semester continues |

## Ungrading
The percentages listed in the timeline refer to approximate time/effort needed to successfully complete the project and the course. The rubric for grading in this course is simple – all students are eligible to receive a 4.0 for satisfactory consistent engagement, effort and delivery of (1) a predictive model in Week 8 and (2) a technical paper and presentation at the end of the course. 

So, what is “ungrading”? In reviewing your performance in this course, we will use vocabulary commensurate with professional work in non-academic jobs. I will not be grading you but rather assessing your progress in the course against timelines and benchmarks. I will not answer questions about “what grade did I get?” but will rather ask YOU “what did you learn?”. There will be no judgement, criticism or negative indicators usually associated with the usual system of percentages and letter grades. Instead, the focus will be on the challenges and opportunities presented to you in the course, your engagement, and the use of constructive feedback from myself and Kim to contribute to you meeting the learning objectives in the course. 

At any time in this course, if I, as the instructor, or Kim, the co-instructor, feel that a student has fallen below the level of expectation of engagement, effort and contribution, I, Dr. Bibelnieks, will contact the student for a one-on-one meeting. Together, the student and I will decide how to move forward in the course. This discussion will include discussion of possible options for ending the course with a 4.0 or an agreed upon lesser grade. The lesser grade will be contractual with specific obligations and expectations articulared for the student.

## Communication Etiquette 
### Slack communications
Most of our online comminication will take place on Slack. While communicating online, please note the following:

- Before posting a question, please make sure that the same question has not been posted before.
- Slack channels are:
  - *in-class*: chat during Zoom lectures and any questions on the course content
  - *resources*: reading responses
  - *wids-datathon*: project discussion
  - *people*: bios of everyone in the course 
- If you choose to post memes or any jokes, be mindful. Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics jokes are always welcome.
- Respect opinions of others.
- There are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask.
- If somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, show them in which lecture we have covered the topic.
- Be generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other.
- Answer each other's questions. 

### Email communications
Please only email about course content if it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on Slack so that we can all learn together. This way the instructors will only have to answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact one of your peers may even answer it before one of us do. 

While communicating over email, please make sure the email
- has an informative subject line including the course code.
- articulates your question or problem well.
- has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards etc.
- has your name at the end.
