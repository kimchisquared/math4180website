      <description>Course Objectives At the end of this semester you will be able to:
 perform data visualization, data cleaning, data augmentation and data organization apply ethical uses of data in using results of data analytic discern appropriate statistical, computational, and modeling approaches to data problems write technical and nontechnical reports of data analytic insights write professional level correspondence to ask questions/gather information give professional level presentations to technical and nontechnical audiences whether in academic or industrial settings  Assessment It is our intent to design assessments that are a source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress.</description>
