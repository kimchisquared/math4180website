Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics jokes are always welcome. Respect opinions of others. There are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask. If somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, show them in which lecture we have covered the topic. Be generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other. Answer each other’s questions.  Email communications Please only email about course content if it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on Slack so that we can all learn together. This way the instructors will only have to answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact one of your peers may even answer it before one of us do.\nWhile communicating over email, please make sure the email\n has an informative subject line including the course code. articulates your question or problem well. has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards etc. has your name at the end.
