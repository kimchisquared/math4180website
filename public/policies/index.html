Assessments serve the purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved of the course goals). The time zones indicated for all assessments are in Central Standard Time.\n        Participation   Attendance and participation during class Zoom lectures is essential and expected. Project team meetings outside of class will be required.   Evaluations   Starting week 4, project groups will get together to delegate the group roles for project related assignments. You are required to contribute equally to any group task(s) assigned to you. As this is the first hands-on experience for many of the students in the course, there may come a time where a single task turns out to be more time-consuming than originally planned. This is the only time re-delegating tasks is acceptable. As such, you will be required to submit evaluations on your yourself, documenting the tasks you have completed along with your group. The goal of the evaluations is to prepare you and your group members to write and finalize your technical report of the project in a timely manner.   Reading Responses and Assignments   You are required to complete weekly reading and/or coding tasks as outlined on the course website. The schedule is fluid and may be adjusted to ensure the timeliness of tasks and data project are appropriate for the course   Project   Overview: You will complete a project with a group of 3-4 students. The project will focus on creating a model to classify patient health data and requires a submission to the associated competition. You will apply the methods learned in this course to answer whether patients diagnoses could inform treatment and ultimately lead to better outcomes. The sections of this project will be communicated to you in advance and with more detail.   Presentation: Your group will give a final 30-minute group presentation that may be recorded. This presentation will be held during the last week of class for this course. The specific date each group presents will be announced later on in the semester.   Technical Paper: Your group will write a technical paper summarizing the work of the semester. The breadth, depth and scope of the content will determine the length (minimum 3-pages written in the style of a LaTex journal article). Resources for technical writing and LaTex will be shared under the Materials section as the semester continues    Timeline    Calendar %Grade Course Component     Weeks 1 – 2 10% Data Visualization and basic statistics and analytic techniques.     Focus on software, accessing data, preliminary data science techniques.   Weeks 3 – 4 15% In depth look at data project and review of research literature.     Continued teaching and development of knowledge/use of RStudio, github, and Slack.     Focus on techniques of imputing data values and missing data.   Weeks 4 – 5 10% Project team selection and teamwork begins. Preliminary data/strategy exploration, literature/outside data source research, development of management timelines (specific to project).     Continued teaching and development of knowledge/use of RStudio, Github, Slack for communication with focus on ethics of data use and analysis   Weeks 6 – 10 30% Data project work continues (with weekly management timelines/ benchmark setting)     Continued development of use of RStudio, github, Slack. Predictions of modeling due March 1 (Week 8).   Weeks 11 – 12 10% Preliminary report and assessment of strategic problem solutions with emphasis on further exploration/extension of project/data analysis.     Continued work on finalizing projects.   Weeks 13 – 14 15% In-house preparation/practice of final presentations, technical reports.     Development of personal netlify websites.   Week 15 10% Finalizing formal presentations to class.     Submission of final project products (technical paper and video presentation).     Final presentations will take place during Final Exam week.    Ungrading The percentages listed in the timeline refer to approximate time/effort needed to successfully complete the project and the course. The rubric for grading in this course is simple – all students are eligible to receive a 4.0 for satisfactory consistent engagement, effort and delivery of (1) a predictive model in Week 8 and (2) a technical paper and presentation at the end of the course.\nSo, what is “ungrading”? In reviewing your performance in this course, we will use vocabulary commensurate with professional work in non-academic jobs. I will not be grading you but rather assessing your progress in the course against timelines and benchmarks. I will not answer questions about “what grade did I get?” but will rather ask YOU “what did you learn?”. There will be no judgement, criticism or negative indicators usually associated with the usual system of percentages and letter grades. Instead, the focus will be on the challenges and opportunities presented to you in the course, your engagement, and the use of constructive feedback from myself and Kim to contribute to you meeting the learning objectives in the course.\nAt any time in this course, if I, as the instructor, or Kim, the co-instructor, feel that a student has fallen below the level of expectation of engagement, effort and contribution, I, Dr. Bibelnieks, will contact the student for a one-on-one meeting. Together, the student and I will decide how to move forward in the course. This discussion will include discussion of possible options for ending the course with a 4.0 or an agreed upon lesser grade. The lesser grade will be contractual with specific obligations and expectations articulared for the student.\nAccommodations University of Minnesota, Duluth is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with permanent or temporary disabilities. This syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. If you have a disability that impacts your participation in this class, please contact Disability Resources as soon as possible. Students approved for accommodations will notify the instructor by sending out a Faculty Notification Letter from the Disabilities Resources website.\nDisability Resources -258 Kirby Student Center - website - email - (218) 726-6130\nDiversity The University of Minnesota, Duluth, in accordance with applicable Federal and State law and University policy, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or service in the uniformed services. The University also prohibits sexual harassment. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission, access, and treatment in University programs and activities.\nInclusion Our goal is to make everyone (yes, that includes you too) feel welcome, not only in our classroom but also in the field of statistics and data science. If there is any reason you do not feel welcome in this class, please talk to one of us. If anything is said to you that makes you feel uncomfortable, please talk to one of us. If there is any life event that is interfering with your learning in this class, please talk to one of us. We may not be able to solve all your problems, but we may be able to direct you to the right resources on campus.\nCommunication Etiquette Slack communications Most of our online comminication will take place on Slack. While communicating online, please note the following:\n Before posting a question, please make sure that the same question has not been posted before. Slack channels are:  in-class: chat during Zoom lectures and any questions on the course content resources: reading responses wids-datathon: project discussion people: bios of everyone in the course   If you choose to post memes or any jokes, be mindful. Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics jokes are always welcome. Respect opinions of others. There are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask. If somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, show them in which lecture we have covered the topic. Be generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other. Answer each other’s questions.  Email communications Please only email about course content if it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on Slack so that we can all learn together. This way the instructors will only have to answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact one of your peers may even answer it before one of us do.\nWhile communicating over email, please make sure the email\n has an informative subject line including the course code. articulates your question or problem well. has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards etc. has your name at the end.  Here is a sample email\n",

<li>If somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, show them in which lecture we have covered the topic.</li>
<li>Be generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other.</li>
<li>Answer each other&rsquo;s questions.</li>

<p>Please only email about course content if it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on Slack so that we can all learn together. This way the instructors will only have to answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact one of your peers may even answer it before one of us do.</p>
<p>While communicating over email, please make sure the email</p>
<ul>
<li>has an informative subject line including the course code.</li>
<li>articulates your question or problem well.</li>
<li>has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards etc.</li>
<li>has your name at the end.</li>
