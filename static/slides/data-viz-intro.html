#Recap: Why data science?

---
- While programming is useful and I am excited to improve my coding skills, it’s comforting to know I don’t need to be an expert at it in order to succeed in this course and in the world of data science. 
- all students (or anyone) can benefit from "awareness and competence" in data science

- With data science drawing from so many different fields (CS, Statistics, Data Expert, Mathematics, Modeling), where does one start his/her studies to actually become a data scientist and be fluent within the field?

- "operations" the authors were referring to when describing coding and wheter we should think about these "operations" in more of a mathematical sense or a computer science sense

- What is the scientific goal? Do we have the relevant data to reach this goal? What do we want to predict? If we aren’t asking the right questions from the start, we will never find the outcomes that we are looking for.
- it is so important to make sure that you are looking at the right data, because anyone can just take numbers and put them in a graph but then the graph will not have a story so you have to make sure that you are asking and answering the right questions to be helpful.

- further discussion about the future of statistics. As we move away from computational methods, and increase our emphasis on technological processes, what is next for statistics as a field? Will the methods and tests still be considered viable tools when most of the data is observed, and not random?
- more detail about the future of statistics since they seemed to imply that the field is becoming obsolete with modern technology and overflow of data. 

- My question is based on the rapid advancements in data science – and continued collection of large sums of data. What are the next steps in the data revolution? I feel like we are very naïve to the possibilities that could happen past our lifetimes.

- broadly summarize commonly employed data tools.

- An example of this would be taking race, gender, and social status into consideration when "scoring" individuals for how well they perform a task. We all need to be mindful that just because we have all of this information, it does not mean that it is morally right to use it in every instance.

- I am wondering, do the original researchers have to give permission for their data to be publicly used? Or once the information is out there, is it free game?

- will we be working with sports data at all this semester?
- sabermetrics. It is stated that the first analysts used a spreadsheet but I am curious as to how they read the spreadsheet or if they used any statistical tests. Or rather, did they just look at basic computations such as averages?

#data visualizations

- are graphical representations of data

--

- use different colors, shapes, and the coordinate system to summarize data

--

- tell a story

--

- are useful for exploring data; we call this exploratory data analysis

# how to use ggplot

If you have never used a package before you will need to install it. 

--


```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

--

You only ever need to do this step once. Usually I just run this command in my Console rather than put it inside my **.Rmd** file. 

You can see which packages you have installed by going to Your Files, Plots, Packages panel, selecting Packages, and searching *ggplot2* in the Search bar.

--

You can now load the package. 

--


```r
library(ggplot2)
```

--

You need to run this command *every* time you open a file. It may be useful to keep a chunk at the beginning of your file where you store all the libraries you plan to use.
