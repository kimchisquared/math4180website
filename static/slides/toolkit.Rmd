# Learning Goals

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- perform data visualization, data cleaning, data augmentation and data organization

- gain insight from data, reproducibly (with literate programming and version control) and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques

# Reproducibility checklist

**What does it take for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?**

--

Short-term goals:
- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?

- Does the code actually do what you think it does?

- In addition to what was done, is it clear why it was done?

--


Long-term goals:
- Can the code be used for other data?

- Can you extend the code to do other things?

#Toolkit for reproducibility


- Scripting &rightarrow;**R**

- Literate programming &rightarrow;   **R Markdown**

- Version control &rightarrow; **Git/Github**

#R and RStudio
.pull-left[
- R is an open-source statistical **programming language**

- R is also and environment for statistical computing and graphics

- It is extendable to suit your needs by installing *packages*
]

--

.pull-right[
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment) e.g. *"I write code in the RStudio IDE"*

- RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists
]
---
#R packages
- **Packages** are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data

- As of January 2021, there are over 16,000 R packages available on CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)

- We're going to work with a small (but important) subset of these!
