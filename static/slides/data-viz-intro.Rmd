# how to use ggplot

If you have never used a package before you will need to install it. 

--

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

--

You only ever need to do this step once. Usually I just run this command in my Console rather than put it inside my **.Rmd** file. 

You can see which packages you have installed by going to Your Files, Plots, Packages panel, selecting Packages, and searching *ggplot2* in the Search bar.

--

You can now load the package. 

--

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

--

You need to run this command *every* time you open a file. It may be useful to keep a chunk at the beginning of your file where you store all the libraries you plan to use.
